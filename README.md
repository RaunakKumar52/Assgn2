# Assgn2
Assignment 2 : WIDS 
I’m a first year student and honestly this assignment was a bit intimidating at the start. I had never worked with a real dataset like this before, so things like understanding the columns, plotting graphs, and even reading correlation matrices felt overwhelming. I relied a lot on basic resources like **GeeksforGeeks** to understand Python, pandas functions, and machine learning concepts step by step. I also watched the **StatQuest playlist** to make sense of ideas like linear regression, PCA. My mentor provided all the necessary tools to figure it out. 


The assignment covered core topics in data analysis and machine learning, starting with **data loading and exploration using pandas**, along with **histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps** to understand distributions, outliers, and relationships between features. It also involved **geographical visualization** using latitude and longitude to study housing price patterns.

Further, the assignment introduced **feature scaling**, **PCA**, and building a **multiple linear regression model using a scikit-learn pipeline**. We evaluated the model using **MSE, MAE, R², and adjusted R²**, and used **predicted vs actual** and **residual plots** to understand model performance and limitations.
